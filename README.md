# Hidden Flag Challenge

Welcome to the Hidden Flag Challenge! Your goal is to decrypt a hidden message from an image.

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Flag Extraction**:  
   The flag is hidden inside the image `hidden_flag_image.png` using **Steganography**. You'll need to extract it using appropriate tools.

2. **Decryption**:  
   The flag is encrypted with a key derived from a well-known phrase, which can be deduced by interpreting a **sign language video**.

3. **Key Derivation**:  
   Once you identify the correct football team, you will have the phrase needed for the key. To decrypt the flag, the encryption key is generated by **base64 encoding** the phrase and using that base64 string as the key.

### Hint:

- The key to decrypting the flag is a well-known phrase: **"{x} is forever champion."**  
  (Where **x** is my favorite football team, which is hinted at in this **video.mp4** video

- Once you find the football team, you will need to base64-encode the phrase, and then use that encoded string as the key to decrypt the flag.

### Happy Hacking!
